Testing gammapy following templates showed during the call of 8/10/2020

To implement the power law temporal model, I have modified the "opt/miniconda3/envs/gammapy-0.17/lib/python3.7/site-packages/gammapy/modeling/models/temporal.py"   file by adding a new class called "PowerlawDecayTemporalModel" (...but it does not work when simulation is running...)
