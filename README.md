## temporal.py
To implement the power law temporal model, I have modified the "opt/miniconda3/envs/gammapy-0.17/lib/python3.7/site-packages/gammapy/modeling/models/temporal.py"   file by adding a new class called "PowerlawDecayTemporalModel" 

The code does not work when simulating data, I don't understand why...
